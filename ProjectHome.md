Originally envisioned as a personal Magic: The Gathering game engine/learn to program project, JMTG has evolved into a more amorphous being.

JMTG attempts to be a neutral TCG framework. It intends to provide local and networked play, card/deck/set/rule creation and management, and some other, future features. It is stupidly ambitious and will, in all likelihood, fail miserably.

With that said, I'm working towards a black triangle status using the new Magic rules update as a guinea pig. Rule- and card-sets are **not** included, to avoid any copyright-related messiness.

One of the biggest itches JMTG attempts to scratch is for the surrounding TCG culture, where player-built cards, sets and rule modifications are able to be plugged in and play-tested with little effort or coding on the player's part. This is to be done with a consistent card file format and authorization framework, consistent hooks for rulesets, and pears with eternal-youth-giving properties from magic trees.
