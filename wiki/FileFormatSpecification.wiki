= Introduction =

A .mtg file is an encrypted .zip containing at minimum, an XML file and an image (.jpg or .png), and optionally one or more .py files.

<p>JMTG is a game engine, and is intended to be used with both existing card designs as well as lending itself to new designs and card-swapping. To do this effectively yet securely, it implements a process similar to how many Linux repositories work. JMTG stores one or more public keys (by default it just has one game-specific one). Cards are stored in .mtg files, which are saved to the cards/ directory (specified in the settings).</p>

<p>The .mtg files are encrypted with the creator's private key. They are decrypted when you import them into your library. The decrypted .mtg file is a gzip-compressed folder containing an XML file (validated against the JMTG RELAX NG XML schema), zero or more images (zero: uses default placeholder image; > 1: uses primary image as specified in the XML file by default) and zero or more .py files (if needed, they are referred to in the XML file).</p>

<p>Optionally, the XML file can specify a hash value and a remote site to compare hashes against, to ensure against player modifications when networking. This idea needs a little fleshing out - how would one ensure that each player is using the same (intended) card?</p>
